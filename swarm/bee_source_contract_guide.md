## 前言

Swarm 项目和其它的区块链存储项目有很大不同，比如　Filecoin，Swarm 是构建在以太坊二层网络的去中心化存储项目，Layer2　的核心实现用到了智能合约，下面以　Swarm 的官方实现　Bee　源码为例，概述用到的智能合约。

## Bzz　和　xBzz 

Bzz　是部署在以太坊上的合约，xBzz部署在　xDai　网络的合约，其中，Bzz　桥接到了　xDai网络。

Bzz　桥接到　xDai　：https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge

 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
